### 2. [Passo uno](https://passo.uno/why-technical-writing/)

> **About “passo uno”**
> Passo uno is Italian for stop-motion. It also means step one.
> Choosing the first step of a procedure is often the most critical part of technical writing. At the same time, good UX writing can be seen as a sequence of discrete steps, a stop-motion dialogue which flows like a real conversation. I also wanted the domain name to reflect my ancestry: I was born in Italy and consider myself Italian, though I’ve lived in Spain for longer.

### 3. [政治学的邀约](https://finelin.notion.site/finelin/8f0e84b281894a9fb599e5ac8c511faf)

> 我从 2020 年开始比较集中地在微博上写一些文献的介绍，旨在把有趣的研究分享给更多人，同时也是回报自己曾经收益于许多前辈相似的贡献。现在陆续累计了有七十余篇，按照话题整理一个目录，供新关注的朋友查询。原本只是想发长微博，可惜我似乎被限制发布链接了。正好借此机会，整理成文章，方便保存。目录中每个问题都对应一条微博，每条微博都是一篇文章。简介或长或短，并不固定，取决于我那天有多闲。

> The best I can figure so far is that you'd send back a list of ALL of the place names for a given area and let the device figure out which times apply to which photos, and just discard the rest. Also, it should probably be "zoomed out" pretty far, such that only very coarse bounds are given to the server. Just return all of the mappings for all of the polygons or whatever inside some giant swath of space, and do all of the nitty gritty stuff on their device.

### 2. [LOW-TECH MAGAZINE](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/)

Doubts on progress and technology

> Low-tech Magazine underscores the potential of past and often forgotten technologies and how they can inform sustainable energy practices. Technology has become the idol of our society, but technological progress is—more often than not—aimed at solving problems caused by earlier technical inventions.

> There is a lot of potential in past and often forgotten knowledge and technologies when it comes to designing a sustainable society. Interesting possibilities arise when you combine old technology with new knowledge and new materials, or when you apply old concepts and traditional knowledge to modern technology.
